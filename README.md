Stinkbugs-BnB is a clone of AirBnB built with NodeJS and MongoDB as a group project during week 5 by team Glossy Stinkbugs of the May 2018 cohort at Makers Academy.

The tests are written using Cypress. Run them from the command line with `cypress run`.

## Technologies used

- Javascript

- Express
- Bcrypt
- Nodemailer
- Cypress
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Bootstrap / CSS

## Group workflow

We held stand ups every morning to discuss our achievements and/or blockages from the day before, plans for the day and allocate tickets. We used Trello to track our work and split user stories into smaller tasks, running two day sprints to assess our current progress and evaluate which features to focus on implementing.

All pull requests had to be reviewed and approved by at least two other members of the team before they could be merged into the master.

We worked in pairs, and switched regularly to ensure that everyone had a chance to work across all areas of the codebase.
